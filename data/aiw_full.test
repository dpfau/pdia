that s the judge she said to herself because of his great wig
the judge by the way was the king and as he wore his crown over the wig look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly not becoming
and that s the jury box thought alice and those twelve creatures she was obliged to say creatures you see because some of them were animals and some were birds i suppose they are the jurors
she said this last word two or three times over to herself being rather proud of it for she thought and rightly too that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all
however jury men would have done just as well
the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates
what are they doing
alice whispered to the gryphon
they can t have anything to put down yet before the trial s begun
they re putting down their names the gryphon whispered in reply for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial
stupid things
alice began in a loud indignant voice but she stopped hastily for the white rabbit cried out silence in the court
and the king put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round to make out who was talking
alice could see as well as if she were looking over their shoulders that all the jurors were writing down stupid things
on their slates and she could even make out that one of them didn t know how to spell stupid and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him
a nice muddle their slates ll be in before the trial s over
thought alice
one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked
this of course alice could not stand and she went round the court and got behind him and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away
she did it so quickly that the poor little juror it was bill the lizard could not make out at all what had become of it so after hunting all about for it he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day and this was of very little use as it left no mark on the slate
herald read the accusation
said the king
on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and then unrolled the parchment scroll and read as follows the queen of hearts she made some tarts all on a summer day the knave of hearts he stole those tarts and took them quite away
consider your verdict the king said to the jury
not yet not yet
the rabbit hastily interrupted
there s a great deal to come before that
call the first witness said the king and the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out first witness
the first witness was the hatter
he came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other
i beg pardon your majesty he began for bringing these in but i hadn t quite finished my tea when i was sent for
you ought to have finished said the king
when did you begin
the hatter looked at the march hare who had followed him into the court arm in arm with the dormouse
fourteenth of march i think it was he said
fifteenth said the march hare
sixteenth added the dormouse
write that down the king said to the jury and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates and then added them up and reduced the answer to shillings and pence
take off your hat the king said to the hatter
it isn t mine said the hatter
stolen
the king exclaimed turning to the jury who instantly made a memorandum of the fact
i keep them to sell the hatter added as an explanation i ve none of my own
i m a hatter
here the queen put on her spectacles and began staring at the hatter who turned pale and fidgeted
give your evidence said the king and don t be nervous or i ll have you executed on the spot
this did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the queen and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread and butter
just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was she was beginning to grow larger again and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her
i wish you wouldn t squeeze so
said the dormouse who was sitting next to her
i can hardly breathe
i can t help it said alice very meekly i m growing
you ve no right to grow here said the dormouse
don t talk nonsense said alice more boldly you know you re growing too
yes but i grow at a reasonable pace said the dormouse not in that ridiculous fashion
and he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court
all this time the queen had never left off staring at the hatter and just as the dormouse crossed the court she said to one of the officers of the court bring me the list of the singers in the last concert
on which the wretched hatter trembled so that he shook both his shoes off
give your evidence the king repeated angrily or i ll have you executed whether you re nervous or not
i m a poor man your majesty the hatter began in a trembling voice and i hadn t begun my tea not above a week or so and what with the bread and butter getting so thin and the twinkling of the tea the twinkling of the what
said the king
it began with the tea the hatter replied
of course twinkling begins with a t
said the king sharply
do you take me for a dunce
go on
i m a poor man the hatter went on and most things twinkled after that only the march hare said i didn t
the march hare interrupted in a great hurry
you did
said the hatter
i deny it
said the march hare
he denies it said the king leave out that part
well at any rate the dormouse said the hatter went on looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too but the dormouse denied nothing being fast asleep
after that continued the hatter i cut some more bread and butter but what did the dormouse say
one of the jury asked
that i can t remember said the hatter
you must remember remarked the king or i ll have you executed
the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter and went down on one knee
i m a poor man your majesty he began
you re a very poor speaker said the king
here one of the guinea pigs cheered and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court
as that is rather a hard word i will just explain to you how it was done
they had a large canvas bag which tied up at the mouth with strings into this they slipped the guinea pig head first and then sat upon it
i m glad i ve seen that done thought alice
i ve so often read in the newspapers at the end of trials there was some attempts at applause which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court and i never understood what it meant till now
if that s all you know about it you may stand down continued the king
i can t go no lower said the hatter i m on the floor as it is
then you may sit down the king replied
here the other guinea pig cheered and was suppressed
come that finished the guinea pigs
thought alice
now we shall get on better
i d rather finish my tea said the hatter with an anxious look at the queen who was reading the list of singers
you may go said the king and the hatter hurriedly left the court without even waiting to put his shoes on
and just take his head off outside the queen added to one of the officers but the hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door
call the next witness
said the king
the next witness was the duchess s cook
she carried the pepper box in her hand and alice guessed who it was even before she got into the court by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once
give your evidence said the king
shan t said the cook
the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit who said in a low voice your majesty must cross examine this witness
well if i must i must the king said with a melancholy air and after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight he said in a deep voice what are tarts made of
pepper mostly said the cook
treacle said a sleepy voice behind her
collar that dormouse the queen shrieked out
behead that dormouse
turn that dormouse out of court
suppress him
pinch him
off with his whiskers
for some minutes the whole court was in confusion getting the dormouse turned out and by the time they had settled down again the cook had disappeared
never mind
said the king with an air of great relief
call the next witness
and he added in an undertone to the queen really my dear you must cross examine the next witness
it quite makes my forehead ache
alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like for they haven t got much evidence yet she said to herself
imagine her surprise when the white rabbit read out at the top of his shrill little voice the name alice
chapter xii alice s evidence here
cried alice quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury box with the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before
oh i beg your pardon
she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay and began picking them up again as quickly as she could for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury box or they would die
the trial cannot proceed said the king in a very grave voice until all the jurymen are back in their proper places all he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at alice as he said do
alice looked at the jury box and saw that in her haste she had put the lizard in head downwards and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable to move
she soon got it out again and put it right not that it signifies much she said to herself i should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other
as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident all except the lizard who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open gazing up into the roof of the court
what do you know about this business
the king said to alice
nothing said alice
nothing whatever
persisted the king
nothing whatever said alice
that s very important the king said turning to the jury
they were just beginning to write this down on their slates when the white rabbit interrupted unimportant your majesty means of course he said in a very respectful tone but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke
unimportant of course i meant the king hastily said and went on to himself in an undertone important unimportant unimportant important as if he were trying which word sounded best
some of the jury wrote it down important and some unimportant
alice could see this as she was near enough to look over their slates but it doesn t matter a bit she thought to herself
at this moment the king who had been for some time busily writing in his note book cackled out silence
and read out from his book rule forty two
all persons more than a mile high to leave the court
everybody looked at alice
i m not a mile high said alice
you are said the king
nearly two miles high added the queen
well i shan t go at any rate said alice besides that s not a regular rule you invented it just now
it s the oldest rule in the book said the king
then it ought to be number one said alice
the king turned pale and shut his note book hastily
consider your verdict he said to the jury in a low trembling voice
there s more evidence to come yet please your majesty said the white rabbit jumping up in a great hurry this paper has just been picked up
what s in it
said the queen
i haven t opened it yet said the white rabbit but it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner to to somebody
it must have been that said the king unless it was written to nobody which isn t usual you know
who is it directed to
said one of the jurymen
it isn t directed at all said the white rabbit in fact there s nothing written on the outside
he unfolded the paper as he spoke and added it isn t a letter after all it s a set of verses
are they in the prisoner s handwriting
asked another of the jurymen
no they re not said the white rabbit and that s the queerest thing about it
the jury all looked puzzled
he must have imitated somebody else s hand said the king
the jury all brightened up again
please your majesty said the knave i didn t write it and they can t prove i did there s no name signed at the end
if you didn t sign it said the king that only makes the matter worse
you must have meant some mischief or else you d have signed your name like an honest man
there was a general clapping of hands at this it was the first really clever thing the king had said that day
that proves his guilt said the queen
it proves nothing of the sort
said alice
why you don t even know what they re about
read them said the king
the white rabbit put on his spectacles
where shall i begin please your majesty
he asked
begin at the beginning the king said gravely and go on till you come to the end then stop
these were the verses the white rabbit read they told me you had been to her and mentioned me to him she gave me a good character but said i could not swim
he sent them word i had not gone we know it to be true if she should push the matter on what would become of you
i gave her one they gave him two you gave us three or more they all returned from him to you though they were mine before
if i or she should chance to be involved in this affair he trusts to you to set them free exactly as we were
my notion was that you had been before she had this fit an obstacle that came between him and ourselves and it
don t let him know she liked them best for this must ever be a secret kept from all the rest between yourself and me
that s the most important piece of evidence we ve heard yet said the king rubbing his hands so now let the jury if any one of them can explain it said alice she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn t a bit afraid of interrupting him i ll give him sixpence
i don t believe there s an atom of meaning in it
the jury all wrote down on their slates she doesn t believe there s an atom of meaning in it but none of them attempted to explain the paper
if there s no meaning in it said the king that saves a world of trouble you know as we needn t try to find any
and yet i don t know he went on spreading out the verses on his knee and looking at them with one eye i seem to see some meaning in them after all
said i could not swim you can t swim can you
he added turning to the knave
the knave shook his head sadly
do i look like it
he said
which he certainly did not being made entirely of cardboard
all right so far said the king and he went on muttering over the verses to himself we know it to be true that s the jury of course i gave her one they gave him two why that must be what he did with the tarts you know but it goes on they all returned from him to you said alice
why there they are
said the king triumphantly pointing to the tarts on the table
nothing can be clearer than that
then again before she had this fit you never had fits my dear i think
he said to the queen
never
said the queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the lizard as she spoke
the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger as he found it made no mark but he now hastily began again using the ink that was trickling down his face as long as it lasted
then the words don t fit you said the king looking round the court with a smile
there was a dead silence
it s a pun
the king added in an offended tone and everybody laughed let the jury consider their verdict the king said for about the twentieth time that day
no no
said the queen
sentence first verdict afterwards
stuff and nonsense
said alice loudly
the idea of having the sentence first
hold your tongue
said the queen turning purple
i won t
said alice
off with her head
the queen shouted at the top of her voice
nobody moved
who cares for you
said alice she had grown to her full size by this time
you re nothing but a pack of cards
at this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down upon her she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and tried to beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face
wake up alice dear
said her sister why what a long sleep you ve had
oh i ve had such a curious dream
said alice and she told her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and when she had finished her sister kissed her and said it was a curious dream dear certainly but now run in to your tea it s getting late
so alice got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been
but her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her head on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of little alice and all her wonderful adventures till she too began dreaming after a fashion and this was her dream first she dreamed of little alice herself and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers she could hear the very tones of her voice and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes and still as she listened or seemed to listen the whole place around her became alive the strange creatures of her little sister s dream
the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried by the frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends shared their never ending meal and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution once more the pig baby was sneezing on the duchess s knee while plates and dishes crashed around it once more the shriek of the gryphon the squeaking of the lizard s slate pencil and the choking of the suppressed guinea pigs filled the air mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock turtle
so she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and all would change to dull reality the grass would be only rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep bells and the queen s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy and the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the gryphon and all the other queer noises would change she knew to the confused clamour of the busy farm yard while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtle s heavy sobs
